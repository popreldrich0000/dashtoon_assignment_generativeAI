# dashtoon_assignment_generativeAI
In this assignmnet we will be using the following research paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07188.pdf
This was the original Paper that Introduced Neural Style Learning
I did not entirely copy the paper but introduced some new changes according to the subtleties required by the assignment. 

We first started the assignment by Web scraping and then processing it further for our use.


We Scraped the data from  https://www.mangageko.com/reader/en/her-summon-chapter-1--eng-li/
where all the images are made by only 1 artist. And hence we will make an encoder-decoder type CNN for extracting the "style" of the images drawn by the given artist. 



(!Disclamer- All the data used in this project is only for acadmic purposes and I DO NOT own any of the data!!)
